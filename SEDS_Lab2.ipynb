    "Typical python projects use multiple packages for various tasks and some of the packages are shared between projects. However, sharing same packages between projects can cause problems. A virtual environment is a way to have multiple, parallel instances of the Python interpreter, each with different package sets and different configurations, avoiding the problems caused by sharing.\n",

    "#### More About Lists Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "List are like strings, they can be indexed and sliced. For example lets create a list called `my_list` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [_ for _ in 'abcdefghi']\n",
    "my_list\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Indexing\n",
    "To retrieve an element of the list, we use the index operator (`[]`). Note that:\n",
    "* Lists are “zero indexed”.\n",
    "* It is possible to use negative indexing (from the end of the list), where `[-1]` returns the last element. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8\n",
    "  ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Slicing\n",
    "A slice is a subset of list elements. In the case of lists, a single slice will always be of contiguous elements. Slice notation takes the form\n",
    "`\n",
    "my_list[start:stop]\n",
    "`\n",
    "where `start` is the index of the first element to include, and `stop` is the index of the item to stop at without including it in the slice. So `my_list[1:5]` returns `['b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stepping\n",
    "The slicer can take an optional third argument, which sets the interval at which elements are included in the slice. So `my_list[::2]` returns `['a', 'c', 'e', 'g', 'i']`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8\n",
